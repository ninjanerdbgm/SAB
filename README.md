This is messy code, fyi.

I put this together from scratch in about 5 hours, but it gets the job done.

The only dependency is PRAW atm, but I'm hoping to add more features.

On the to-do list:
	Irssi integration

Yeah, just that for now.  That's a whole other mess to tackle.  I'm thinking to run it through twisted.

Anyway, enjoy.
