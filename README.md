This is messy code, fyi.

I put this together from scratch in about 5 hours, but it gets the job done.

All this thing does is search /r/askreddit/hot for posts marked with the [Stories] tag and then
it makes a list of all the stories for an easier way to search.

It looks pretty bad on mobile.

The only dependency is PRAW atm, but I'm hoping to add more features.

On the to-do list:
	Irssi integration
	Make it look nice on mobile

Yeah, just that for now.  That's a whole other mess to tackle.  I'm thinking to run it through twisted.

Anyway, enjoy.
